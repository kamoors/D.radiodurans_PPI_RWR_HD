# D.radiodurans_PPI_RWR_HD
This repository contains the R code and Cytoscape files that were used for the project in the MSB course Network Biology.

Project code.R contains the R script that was used to extract the giant component from the filtered networks.

The following 3 files contain the full subnetworks for each of the proteins (integer in title correspons to confidence cut-off; e.g. 900 = 0.9 and above)

Analysis of RecA - 950_Deinococcus_radiodurans.sif
Analysis of UvrC - 900_Deinococcus_radiodurans.sif
Analysis of PprA - 700_Deinococcus_radiodurans.sif


The following 3 files contain the giant component for each of the subnetworks. The Random walk with restart and Heat diffusion algorithms were performed using these subnetworks:

Analysis of RecA - N950_giant.sif
Analysis of UvrC - N900_giant.sif
Analysis of PprA - N700_giant.sif

Supplementary materials 1.rar - contains the tables with final sorted probabilities for the three proteins as source nodes
Supplementary materials 2.rar - contains the full GO enrichment analysis list for the RecA and UvrC RWR results 
Supplementary materials 3.txt - contains the additional GO enrichment analysis performed on the lower cluster of the RecA visualization.


All plots can be generated by running the Project code.R file

All network visualizations are also available as files in the repository
